Sometimes I just admire the beauty of nature as I look at these amazing clouds

I also like checking out airshows. At the World War II Weekend 2019 at Reading, PA, I saw this Curtiss P-40 Warhawk. It is very special in that they are known as the Flying Tigers, flown by the American Volunteer Group during WWII to defend Chinese skies.

I guess I have always liked planes. This is the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15, a Soviet-era jet that China imported.
